Since this will be linked to my MongoDB atlas database I've withheld the password so this app won't work.
If you still want to use this app then go into server.js and change the value of 'mongoURL' to the string of you mongoDB database.
Install packages by typing in the console 'npm install', make sure you have node beforehand.
In powershell to change the port, type '$env:PORT=' then the number of the port.
Type in the console 'node server' and then navigate to:
http://localhost:3000/ or whatever your port number is.
The app should be self-explanatory, register an account and login and logout.
